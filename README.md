This game is turn-based dungeon crawler game that is Diablo themed. 
It starts off where you, the player, must fight with all the enemies 
you encounter in order to defeat the ultimate boss, Diablo. The player 
starts off with a set of resistances and damages that are necessary
to understand in order to strategize how to fight the enemies you encounter.
You will be given a map view in which you can choose what enemies to 
fight and an activity log that displays all the attacks and damages 
done throughout combat. Once defeating an enemy, you obtain items 
that will help you along your journey to defeat the ultimate boss. 
As you continue to move up the map, enemies become more stronger, 
but with your items, you have a greater possibility of defeating 
them and thus, being able to face Diablo in the end. 

Note: If the map does not load up properly (bottoms controls are missing), 
resize your application window for the map view.
